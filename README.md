# Creative-Embedded-Systems-Portfolio
This is my portfolio for COMSBC3930, Creative Embedded Systems. So far it includes my initial soldering project!

Here is the description for the soldering hw:


This is my submission for the soldering homework. I am titling it "I love to Solder."It is a board with 14 pins and a brass wire connected to it on both ends, with the wire bent to form a heart.


To make this, I visited the lab in the basement of Sulz and Miles taught me how to use the soldering pen and solder to connect pins to the board. I started by connecting all 14 pins, and then I soldered both ends of the brass wire to holes that were next to each other. I used pliers to make the vertex of the heart, and then fiddled with it to get the shape I wanted. This is the first time I've ever done something like this, so for me this felt really exciting and also got me excited for future projects. I made it into a heart because I was inspired by the heart project we're about to do, but also I just think it's cool to make stuff that spreads love and joy! I want that to be the theme of all the things I create in this class, and I think it's awesome to create hardware/software/machines/systems that are focused on that instead of just utility (or profit, why stuff is mostly made in the real world).
