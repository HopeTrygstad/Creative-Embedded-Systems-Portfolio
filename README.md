# Creative-Embedded-Systems-Portfolio
This repository contains my portfolio of project documentation for COMS3930, Creative Embedded Systems.

So far, there have been two projects:
- project1: soldering pins and brass wire to circuit board.
- project2: creating a PCB with a battery-powered flashing LED and 555 timer chip.
